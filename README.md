# Project Title:
Movie Recommendation System

# Project Description:
In this project, I've developed a movie recommendation system using Jupyter, Python, and Pandas. The goal is to provide users with a seamless experience to discover movies they might enjoy. By typing the name of a movie into an input box, users will instantly receive recommendations for other movies that align with their preferences.
